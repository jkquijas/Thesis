\chapter{Experimental Results} \label{Results}
In this chapter we will show our results.

\section{Dataset Descriptions}

We scraped a scientific publication abstract dataset from Arxiv.org. Concretely, we gathered
publications from the physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology,
and quantitative finance departments. For each department, we considered each \textbf{topic} as a
class. For example, when considering computer science publications, we considered the
"computational complexity" topic as one class, "artificial intelligence" as another class,
and so on. We apply simple preprocessing to the texts by removing non-alphanumeric
characters, and converting to lower case characters. [Overlap Figure] [Class Distribution
