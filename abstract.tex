\chapter*{Abstract}
Convolutional neural networks have seen very large success in computer vision problems
and, more recently, natural language processing tasks. We examine the effects of hyperparameters
on convolutional neural networks when applied in a text classification task. We
also propose a keyword extraction method using a cosine similarity-based metric and a
dataset augmentation application. We show that when we augment our dataset using this
keyword extraction keyword, we can improve model generalization and loss on test data.
